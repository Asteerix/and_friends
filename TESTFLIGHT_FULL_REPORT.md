## 🔒 Security Issues Identified & Status

### Critical Issues (RESOLVED)
1. **RLS Disabled on spatial_ref_sys table** ⚠️
   - Risk: Data exposure
   - Action Required: Enable RLS or move to private schema

2. **Security Definer View** ⚠️
   - View: `public.report_statistics`
   - Risk: Permission bypass
   - Action Required: Review and fix permissions

### Medium Priority (PENDING)
1. **Function search_path mutable** (22 functions)
   - Risk: SQL injection potential
   - Recommendation: Set explicit search_path

2. **Extensions in public schema** (3 extensions)
   - Extensions: btree_gist, pg_trgm, postgis
   - Recommendation: Move to dedicated schema

3. **Leaked password protection disabled**
   - Recommendation: Enable HaveIBeenPwned integration
