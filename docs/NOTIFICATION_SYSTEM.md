- Notifies the user being rated
- Includes rating value and comment in notification

- Fires on `event_participants` table INSERT/UPDATE
- Notifies event creator when someone joins
- Notifies participant when accepted to private event

### 4. Event Removal Trigger
- Fires on `event_participants` table UPDATE/DELETE
- Notifies user when removed from event

### 5. Story Like Trigger
- Fires on `story_likes` table INSERT
- Notifies story owner (except self-likes)

### 6. Story Comment Trigger
- Fires on `story_comments` table INSERT
- Notifies story owner (except self-comments)
- Shows preview of comment in notification

## Manual Notification Creation

You can also create notifications manually using the helper function:

```typescript
import { createNotification } from '@/utils/notifications';

await createNotification({
  userId: 'recipient-user-id',
  type: 'friend_request',
  title: 'New Friend Request',
  body: 'John Doe sent you a friend request',
  relatedUserId: 'sender-user-id',
  data: {
    sender_name: 'John Doe',
    sender_username: 'johndoe'
  }
});
```

## Real-time Updates

The notification system uses Supabase real-time subscriptions:
- New notifications appear instantly
- Read status updates in real-time
- Unread count badge updates automatically

## Permissions (RLS)

- Users can only see their own notifications
- Users can only update (mark as read) their own notifications
- Users can only delete their own notifications
- System/triggers can create notifications for any user

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the system:
```bash
node scripts/test-notifications.js
```

This will check:
- Table structure
- Trigger existence
- Manual notification creation
- Function availability
- RLS policies

## Future Enhancements

1. Push notifications integration
2. Email notifications for important events
3. Notification preferences/settings
4. Batch notification grouping
5. Rich media notifications (images, videos)
6. Notification sounds/vibrations
