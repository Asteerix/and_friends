## 🎯 TestFlight Readiness

**For TestFlight deployment, the following are CRITICAL:**

### Must Have (Blocking)
1. Event joining/leaving functionality
2. Event listing and search
3. User event dashboard (created/attending)
4. Basic event validation

### Should Have (Important)
1. Event comments and ratings
2. Event notifications
3. Attendee management

### Nice to Have (Enhancement)
1. Event analytics
2. Event templates
3. Advanced filtering

## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1** (TestFlight Blocking): Implement event participation and discovery
2. **Phase 2** (Post-TestFlight): Add social features and notifications  
3. **Phase 3** (Future): Add analytics and templates

This analysis shows that while the event creation and management system is sophisticated and complete, the user-facing features for discovering and participating in events are missing and need immediate implementation for TestFlight readiness.
